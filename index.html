                Everything which happens is as familiar and well known as the rose in the spring and the fruit in summer; for

Hey! Itâ€™s Momina. 
I am an undergrad student at LUMS majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Philosophy. 
I have a keen interest in Reading/Writing/Designing/Photography/Programming/Research and
probably all other Art forms that exist. 

My Favourite Books:
<li id="list">Meditations by Marcus Aurelius</li><li id="list">1984 by George Orwell</li><li id="list">Crying in H Mart by Michelle Zauner</li>
My Favourite Song: Fly Like An Eagle by Steve Miller

Some of my favourite courses at LUMS:
<li id="list">Network Centric Computing CS382</li><li id="list">Modern Physics PHY104</li><li id="list">Intro to Blockchain CS3812</li>

Here are some of my personal projects : 
<li>Travel Journal - React</li>
<div id="proj1">
    <img src="images/trveljournalproject.JPG" alt="" id="travel">
<p id="text1" >This is my travel journal website
that I built using react. It includes
the location, date and a link to the
google maps of the places visited. 
In my freshmen summer I started 
learning react through different
online tutorials. One of the most
useful courses was the one at scrimba.
This website was part of several projects
I completed throughout the course.</p>
</div>

<li>Bookclub Website - HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
<div id="proj1">
    <img src="images/bookclubwebsite.JPG" alt="" id="book">
    <p id="text1">This is my bookclub website that I 
designed using figma and developed using 
HTML,CSS and JavaScript. It was one of my
earliest projects. It included a simple 
home, about, bookclub, contact page and
a few buttons. If you could zoom in a 
little I also designed a logo for my
bookclub :)
</p>
</div>

<li>Expense Manager - React</li>
<div id="proj1">
    <img src="images/expensemanagersnip.JPG" alt="" id="manager">
    <p id="text1">This is my expense manager website, which
I designed using Figma and developed with
React. It calculates your total expenses
for a particular month based on the values
entered and the month selected. It then provides 
an option to add the record to the bar chart. 
I used the Chart.js library to deploy this bar 
chart. A bar chart is an effective way to 
analyze and visualize your expenses over the
course of the entire year.  
</p>
</div>

<li>Personal Lists Website - Flask, Python</li>
<div id="proj1">
    <div id="two-images">
        <img src="images/listwebsite1.JPG" alt="" id="personal-lists">
        <img src="images/listwebsite2.JPG" alt="" id="personal-lists">
    </div>
    <p id="text1">This website helps you keep personal
lists of music, movies, books, and TV shows.
I designed it using Figma/canva and developed
it with Flask/SQLAlchemy for the backend and
simple HTML/CSS for the frontend. Users can
rate and review books, movies, and TV shows,
and add Spotify links for songs. Data for
each element including its name, rating, and
review or the name, artist and link to
spotify incase of song is stored in separate
databases. User can also update and delete data
at any point after it has become part of the 
database. The site analyzes the data based
on ratings and the frequency of songs by
specific artists to provide top picks in all
categories. It offers a compact and
well-organized way to curate your lists.
As a lists enthusiast, I wanted to have all
my lists in one place, and this website was
created to fulfill that need. I hope you
enjoy it as well! I'm also planning to
evolve it further to include more data
analysis, maybe an option for genre etc.

</div>
<li>AirBnB Clone Website - React</li>
<div id="proj1">
    <!-- <img src="bookclubwebsite.JPG" alt="" id="book"> -->
    <p id="text1">I made a clone website of the AirBnB experiences as a part of 
my react course at scrimba. It included all the major details
from the original website e.g images, ratings etc.</p>
</div>
<li>Meme Generator - React</li>
<div id="proj1">
    <p id="text1">I also made a Meme Generator website as a part of my react course
at scrimba. It used Meme API to generate random meme images with
random punchlines to form a completely random meme.</p>
</div>
Here are some of my academic projects :
<li>Enrollment Website - C++</li>
<div id="proj1">
    <p id="text1">As part of my final assignment for the Intro to Programming (CS200)
course in sophomore fall, I applied OOP concepts to implement a
login/signup page for students and admins. The program allowed
students to enroll in or drop courses, and generate their fee
challan based on credit hours. Admins could manage course
capacities, handle waitlists, and add or remove students.</p>
</div>
<li>Student Management System - C++</li>
<div id="proj1">
    <p id="text1">For my final project in the Problem Solving (CS100) course,
which I took in freshman fall, I implemented a login/signup page
similar to an enrollment website. The program enabled admins to
store student information (e.g., name, ID, courses), instructors
to upload student scores, and students to view their personal
details and individual scores.</p>
</div>
<li>Chat Application - Python</li>
<div id="proj1">
    <p id="text1">I took Network Centric Computing (CS382) in my sophomore spring,
completing four programming assignments. I built a chat application
using socket programming and threading, implemented protocols for
efficient packet delivery with windowing, and ensured secure
communication over an unreliable network. Additionally, I
implemented link-state routing for packet transfer and developed
a distributed hash table with join, leave, put, and get functions</p>
</div>
<li>Blockchain Project - Python, Solidity, Remix, JavaScript</li>
<div id="proj1">
    <p id="text1">I took Intro to Blockchain (CS3812) in my sophomore spring, where I
completed multiple programming assignments. I implemented a
transaction verification system for UTXO database management,
developed a block mining mechanism using proof of work, and
built and deployed smart contracts in Solidity, including
a marketplace with a double auction algorithm and a bank system.</p>
